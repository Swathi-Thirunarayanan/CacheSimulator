# CacheSimulator
The developed Cache Simulator uses memory trace file input (generated using pin tool) of 32 bit address and arguments specifying cache size, block size, associativity and cache type (split or shared) to explore hit/miss rates. 

## Pre-requisite:
1. gcc tool
2. pin tool

## Task

1. Develop your own Cache Simulator to read provided Memory Access Trace Files (trace.din) and simulate the behavior of cache.
2. Use pin to create memory trace files for Dhrystone and Linpack benchmarks. 
3. Use these benchmark memory trace files to explore cache miss/hit rates on the developed cache simulator.
